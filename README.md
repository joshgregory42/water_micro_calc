# Water Microwave Calculator

A lot of people in Europe think that it's weird that many Americans don't have an electric kettle and instead use their microwave ovens to heat water.

Electric kettles are better. But I know thermodynamics and heat transfer. So I wrote this program to calculate the time it would take to get water to a certain temperature given the amount of water you have (in mL), the power of your microwave (in Watts, it's usually on the inside label or inside the door), and the temperature you want the water go to.
